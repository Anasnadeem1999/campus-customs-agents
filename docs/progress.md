# HW5 progress

The assignment hands over its problems one at a time, so this table grows as
each new problem arrives rather than being planned out in advance.

| # | Problem | Status |
|---|---|---|
| — | Setup: repo, data, reset script, model check | Done |
| 1 | Vibe coder prompts (`AI_prompts.md`) | Done |
| 2 | *awaiting the next problem from the user* | — |

## Setup — repo, data, reset script, model check

Done before the numbered problems began.

- Unzipped the supplied archive to `data/campus_customs.db` (53 KB, 9 tables).
- `scripts/reset_db.py` copies the seed to `data/campus_customs_new.db`,
  hashes the seed before and after to prove it was not touched, clears stale
  WAL/SHM sidecars, and prints row counts plus cash and `date_today`.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, the working DB copy, `.venv/`, `output/`.
  The seed DB *is* committed — it is the assignment's input and the grader
  needs it to run anything.
- `.env.example` carries placeholders only.
- **Model verified against the live gateway:** `gpt-6-luna` resolves to
  `gpt-6-luna-2026-09-22`. A deliberately wrong name did *not* error — it
  silently answered as `gpt-5.6-luna-2026-07-09`. Hence the runtime assertion
  on `response.model` recorded in CLAUDE.md.

## 1 — Vibe coder prompts

`AI_prompts.md` is the complete log of prompts typed into the vibe coder, in
the format the problem specifies: one section per problem, carrying the
problem number and title, at least one verbatim prompt, and a follow-up prompt
with a note on what the initial prompt was missing.

- Rewrote the file from its earlier shape (grouped by work done) into the
  required per-problem structure.
- The three prompts that preceded the assignment's own numbering — working
  folder, project brief, readiness check — are kept as a **Setup** section, so
  the brief and the ground rules stay in the log.
- Sections with no follow-up say so and explain why the first prompt was
  enough, rather than inventing a prompt that was never typed.
- The file is updated as part of each problem's work, not reconstructed at the
  end.
